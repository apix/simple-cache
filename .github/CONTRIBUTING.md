### Coding Style

- All text files use Unix line endings. The git settings already present in the repository attempts to enforce this.
- When making changes, follow the brace and parenthesis style of the surrounding code.
- Follow the convention laid out in [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).
- Please include tests when adding new features or fixing bugs.
